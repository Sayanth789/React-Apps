# React-Apps

Welcome to **React-Apps**! This repository is a collection of React projects that I am building and experimenting with. The goal is to create small, fun, and useful applications using React and related web technologies.  

## Current Projects
- Each folder in this repo will contain a separate React application.
- Projects will have their own README files as they grow in complexity.

## Features
- Modular structure: Each app is self-contained.
- Easy to clone and run: Just navigate to the app folder and install dependencies.
- Focused on learning and experimentation with React concepts.

## Getting Started

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sayanth789/React-Apps.git

**Navigate to the App Folder** :
